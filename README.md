# Product-Planning-with-RL

In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for optimizing decision-making processes. This study presents a novel approach to production planning in manufacturing systems, leveraging advanced RL algorithms to minimize transition time losses. The proposed Python-based framework integrates state-of-the-art libraries to construct a dynamic model that adapts to real-time changes in the production environment.

The core of the system is a deep reinforcement learning model that learns optimal policies for scheduling tasks without the need for predefined rules. By processing data on transition times, imported from a CSV file, the model continuously refines its strategy to enhance efficiency. The RL agent operates within a simulated environment that mirrors the complexities of actual production lines, including machine availability, task durations, and setup times.

Our methodology employs a Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture, renowned for its ability to handle high-dimensional action spaces. The network is trained using a reward function that penalizes time losses and incentivizes timely task completion. The training process is facilitated by a custom-built Gymnasium environment, which provides a versatile platform for simulating various production scenarios.

The results demonstrate a significant reduction in transition times, leading to a more streamlined production process. The RL model’s ability to learn from experience and adapt to new situations presents a substantial advantage over traditional scheduling methods. Furthermore, the system’s flexibility allows for easy integration with existing manufacturing infrastructures, making it a practical solution for modern industries seeking to enhance productivity through AI.

This research contributes to the understanding of RL applications in complex, real-world systems. It offers a blueprint for future developments in intelligent manufacturing, paving the way for smarter, more responsive production planning that can keep pace with the demands of Industry 4.0.
